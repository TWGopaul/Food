*** Setting up API Key ***
In order to access the Yelp API you must request an access key.
Then in create a config.js file in the src/api directory (ie: src/api/config.js).

The config.js file should contain:
// Store API key
const key =
  "{YOUR API KEY HERE}";
export default key;

The yelp.js file imports the key and uses it to access the API.

*** Location ***
The search location for the app is hard coded at this time. It is currently set to Maryland. 
This can be changed in the src/hooks/useResults.js file, in the searchApi() function.
